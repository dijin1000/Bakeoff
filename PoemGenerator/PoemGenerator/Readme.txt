# A Little Book of Generated Poems
This is a project that generates a html webpage of 3 poems generated by our Poem Generator. The code for the Poem Generator may be RUN in a simple fashion: as an python program. In the following part of this README, we explain how we form the executable from this python program.

In order to RUN the python program, RUN the python start file named 'PoemGenerator.py', which is stored within the 'Code' folder. This 'Code' folder needs to be stored in the same directory with the 'Data_Output' folder, where the Inspiration Set ('stories.json' file) is stored. On running the program, X(second parameter) new poems with Y(third parameter) n-grams in them are generated as 'poems.html'. These may now be viewed by opening the 'poems.html' file in any web browser. In this representation, each of the generated poems contain their unique Titles setup up top and are purposely centred for aesthetic appeal.

The python program can be RUN on any modern computer system, within an appropriate python 3.7 enviroment with the following packages pre-installed:
- the NLTK module for the different corpora as input for our Inspiration Set.
- the Regex module for the usage of regular expressions.
- the Json module for accessing the json-format for our Inspiration Set.
- the pronouncing module for indicating rhyming words in the corpus in order to create a rhyming poem.
- the numpy package, for standard numpy array's.

Our python program operates with three variables that are either initialized as parameters or given to the program if being RUN as an executable. The first parameter being a True or False question, probing if you need to download the corpus (only required at first setup). The second parameter will be regarding the number of poems that should be generated by our program. And the third parameter, defines the number of couplets(bi-grams) a poems should contain.
